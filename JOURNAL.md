# May 28th: Found the servo for the base! 

So today I spent a lot of time (compared to how much time I spend on coding) on finding 1 servo which I will use for the base. I have choosen FeeTech 360 degrees digital servo 7.4 V 35 kg (FT6335M) and its pretty cool and cheap as it costs only â‚¬27.49 well thats it for the 1st hour and now I will find other servos.

**Total time spent: 1h**
